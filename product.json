    "deskripsi": "Palm oil is edible oil which is extracted from the pulp of fruit of oil palms. The color of pulp is red. That's why crude palm oil is naturally similar to pulp color because of high inactive vitamin A content. It is different from kernel oil or coconut oil. Commonly it is combined or mixed with coconut oil to make highly saturated vegetable fat, which is also used for cooking purposes. <br/><br /> <h5 style='text-indent: 40px; text-align:justify'> Main usage of CPO is for cooking purposes and is largely used in South-East Asia, West Africa and some parts of Brazil. Commercial kitchens use it due to its low cost. It's not healthy as its counterparts due to high content of saturated fats. Largest producer of CPO is Indonesia, Malaysia, Nigeria and Columbia. They are major exporters of palm oil. India is net importer of Crude Palm Oil and Mumbai being one of the major trading centers. It is also used for making bio diesel and one of it's by product is Glycerin.</h5>"

    "deskripsi": "Palm oil biofuel is produced from the edible vegetable oil obtained from the fruit of the oil palm tree. In 2004, worldwide production of Soybean oil was around 28 million metric tons which was the most widely produced edible vegetable oil. However, it appears that palm oil may have now surpassed soybean oil production.<br/><br /> <h5 style='text-indent: 40px; text-align:justify'> The palm fruit is the source of both palm oil (extracted from palm fruit) and palm kernel oil (extracted from the fruit seeds). Palm oil itself is reddish because it contains a high amount of betacarotene. Biofuels from palm oil are taking on renewed global importance as countries seek to substitute the soaring price of conventional oil and also cut hazardous emissions. Palm oilâ€™s emergence in the market comes quite some time after the introduction of ethanol, made from sugarcane, and other additives.</h5>"

There are some suppliers of margarine on the market that do not use palm oil.

Trans-fatty acids can form during hardening. These increase the bad LDL cholesterol in the blood and put a strain on the cardiovascular system. In the meantime, margarine producers have recognized the problem and reduced it through other procedures, so that trans fatty acids in margarine are hardly relevant today. Solid fats such as palm oil or coconut oil are added to the margarine to harden it. In contrast to sunflower or rapeseed oil, for example, palm oil is solid at room temperature.</h5> "
